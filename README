Mjolnir is a tank-like Arduino robot that supports wireless video streaming, navigation and camera control. The
robot is operated using the following software components.

1) Simple Arduino Robot Control (SARC) - The robot operating system and supporting libraries. This
   software runs on the robot's central microprocesser, and is responsible for TCP/IP connectivity,
   command processing, LCD output, servo control, and navigation tracking. All source for this
   component is located in the SARC directory.

2) Mjolnir Control Panel (MCP) - An Android client application that integrates video streaming,
   camera control, navigation and debug output into a single user interface. Used to wireless operate
   the robot. All source for this component is located in the MjolnirControlPanel directory.
