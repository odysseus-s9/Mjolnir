--- Disclaimer ---

The usual stuff. Use this code at your own risk. It is not guaranteed, and we are not responsible for any damages, injuries or loss of life that results from it, whether direct or indirect.

This code is currently in beta testing. (I just realized it doesn't even have a version, yet! Let's call it 0.0.1. There, now it does!) It is not production  quality, and some of the tools used to build it are very new technologies!

--- Instructions ---

This code is written to be used in Eclipse. To build it, you need the Arduino Eclipse plug-in and the STL port for AVR. 

I cannot support any of the following. If you have troubles with them, please contact their respective authors. 

1. Get Eclipse installed. Any version that handles C/C++ should work fine. I'm using 4.1 (Indigo). Hopefully you already have this installed - it's nice!

2. Follow the instructions for installing Andy Brown's port of STL for AVR. 
	Please read: 
	http://andybrown.me.uk/ws/2011/01/15/the-standard-template-library-stl-for-avr-with-c-streams/
	for usage and information, then download from his downloads page, here:
	http://andybrown.me.uk/ws/downloads/ 
	(At the time of this writing, a direct download link is: http://andybrown.me.uk/ws/files/avr-stl-1.1.zip However, if he has a newer version, please get that.)
	This library is very cool! If you think so, too, please email Andy and let him know.
	 
3. Install the Arduino plug-in for Eclipse. I'm using:
	Arduino eclipse extensions	1.1.6	it.baeyens.arduino.feature.feature.group	jan Baeyens
	Another great tool! To install and use it, please see this thread on the 
	Arduino forums: 
	http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php/topic,70547.msg589022.html#msg589022
	
	Please read ALL of those instructions. If you have questions or problems, please post on that thread so everyone will benefit from it.
	
	However, I will tell you about one glitch I encountered. When you set up a new Arduino project, you choose your target device(s). I found that mine would not build until I selected a different device and did a build-all for it. Then I could switch back to the original device and build worked. (I think this may be fixed now... but just in case, keep it in mind.) 
	
	Also, you need to follow those instructions ***for every workspace and project*** that you create. (Some are for the entire workspace, but some are for each project.)
	
4. Download the SARC code and add it to an Eclipse workspace. I've not actually done this. I do plan to, and will update this file with additional instructions as needed.

5. After you get things imported, you may see a lot of "Problems" reported by Eclipse. Note that these do *not* get cleared when you build! You can click to select them all, then hit delete to get rid of them.
	
	*** Answer: This is, in fact, caused by the indexer. To resolve it, add the appropriate header files to C/C++ General -> Indexer -> Files to index up front. (I did this in the project settings and will commit this change.) You do not need to include the path. For example, I just added: ", Arduino.h, Ethernet.h, Servo.h" (no quotes). and it cleared up.
	
	These messages do NOT affect the build. Check the Console panel for the true results. If you see "**** Build Finished ****", you have just built SARC and you can upload using the AVR button in Eclipse. (You'll only see it in the C/C++ view.)
	
6. Please support Arduino and open source hardware! See Section9 for links to some of our favorite geek-sites.

One other great open source tool is Eclipse EGit (Git for Eclipse):
  Eclipse EGit	1.1.0.201109151100-r	org.eclipse.egit.feature.group	Eclipse EGit
This works great for accessing Git repositories directly from Eclipse.

While I cannot support this code, I do welcome questions and feedback. I'll reply as I have time. I'm a busy software engineer in my day job, as is Odysseus. But we'd like to share this project, so I hope to be updating this, and that will include new/updated instructions. 

Thanks for you interest and I hope you enjoy the project as much as we do!
